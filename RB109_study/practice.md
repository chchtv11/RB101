```
a = 4

loop do
  a = 5
  b = 3
  break
end

puts a
puts b
```

On line 2, local variable `a` is initialized and is assigned to an object with the value `4`.

On lines 4-8, the `loop` method is called and the `do..end` block is passed to it as an argument. Within the block, on line 5, local variable `a` is reassigned to an object with the value `5`. On line 6, a variable `b` is initialized within the scope of the block. It is assigned to an object with the value `3`.
We are breaking out of the loop on line 7 by using the `break` keyword. Since there are no break conditions, the loop will only run through one iteration.

On line 10, we are calling the `puts` method and passing local variable `a` to it as an argument. This will result in the value of the object assigned to `a` to be printed. The value is now `5` as `a` was initialized before the block and reassigned to `5` within the block.

On line 11, we are calling the `puts` method and passing it the variable `b`.
However, since `b` was not initialized before the block, it is only accessible within the scope of the block and is not available in the local scope.
Therefore, line 11 will throw an error as `b` does not exist in the local scope where the `puts` method is called.

```
a = 4
b = 2

loop do
  c = 3
  a = c
  break
end

puts a
puts b
```

Result:
- Outputs 3
- Outputs 2
- Returns `nil`



3.
```
a = 4
b = 2

2.times do |a|
  a = 5
  puts a
end

puts a
puts b
```

Result:
- `5` will be printed twice 
  - within the block, the variable `a` within the scope of the block is assigned to an object with the value `5` and then printed
- `4` will be printed
  - the value of the local variable `a` is still `4` 
  - It was not changed by the block because variable shadowing prevented it from being accessible within the scope of the block. Only the block parameter `a` was accessible.
- `2` will be printed
  - The value of the object assigned to `b` is `2`
