# RB101 - Notes

- % is modulo operator
  - Differs from Integer#remainder: modulo returns absolute value. Remainder will return negative if given one

- re-do Precedence lesson
- Try to understand this: "Don't display something to the output and return a meaningful value. Since Ruby always returns a value, the key here is that the return value shouldn't be the intent of the method." (https://launchschool.com/lessons/a0f3cd44/assignments/aa99ad2d)
